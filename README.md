TwitterCrawler
==============

A simple twitter crawler. Uses tweets/tweetIDs and mines information. Sample .txt files are included, and it is shown how from the id's or raw text we mine sentiment analysis information. The format of the .txt files created are for use in Weka.

We use the twitter4j library for the twitter interaction with the program.
